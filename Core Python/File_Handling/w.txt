1 Objective The primary objective of this experiment is to gain a practical understanding of fundamental probability distributions Gaussian, Multinomial, and Bernouli 
 by implementing functions to generate samples from them and visualizing their characteristics. 
 Students will observe how increasing sample sizes lead to empirical distributions that better approximate the true underlying probability distributions.
